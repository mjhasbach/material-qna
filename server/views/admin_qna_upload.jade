                | Click or drag-and-drop anywhere in this tab to upload a QnA file. The file must be a JSON array of
                | objects. Each object must have question (string), answers (array of strings), and correctAnswer
                | (number) properties. The correctAnswer property is the 0-based index of the correct answer in the
                | answers array. The object may also contain image (string) and disabled (boolean) properties. The image
                | property may contain up to 2000 characters, and the remaining strings are limited to 255 characters.
                | For example:
            div.example.md-whiteframe-z2(hljs, source='example')
